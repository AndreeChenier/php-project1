PHP project: Net pay calculator 

I am currently doing a PHP certification at George Brown College. For my final project of the first course, Foundations of PHP, I had to calculate the gross pay of an employee. The application accepts the employee's first and last name, weekly hours and hourly wage. The application validates the input and calculates the net pay considering the overtime (1.5 for every hour greater than 40) and taxes (25%).
